## Tips for Best Experience

1. **Natural Speech**: Speak naturally as you would to a friend
2. **Continuous Mode**: Click the mic once for hands-free conversation
3. **Emotional Expression**: The bot responds to your emotional state
4. **Context Building**: Share details for more personalized responses
5. **Memory Benefits**: Use the advanced version for ongoing relationships

## Privacy Note

The advanced version stores conversation history locally in `companion_memory.db`. This enables personalized interactions but means conversations are saved. Delete this file to reset all memory.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Claude Session**: Ensure Claude is running in tmux session named 'claude'
- **SSL Errors**: Certificates are auto-generated; accept the security warning
- **Voice Not Working**: Check microphone permissions in your browser
- **Memory Issues**: Delete `companion_memory.db` to reset if needed
