# Chrome Detection Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was failing to detect Chrome browser even though it was installed at `/usr/bin/google-chrome`. Users were getting "Chrome browser is not installed" error.

## Root Cause
1. Chrome detection paths didn't include `/usr/bin/google-chrome` as the first option
2. User data directory conflicts were causing session creation failures
3. No fallback mechanism when user data directory issues occurred

## Changes Made to `element_scanner_browser.py`

### 1. Enhanced Chrome Detection Paths
Added more Chrome binary paths including:
- `/usr/bin/google-chrome` (added as first option)
- `/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome` (direct path)
- Kept existing paths for compatibility

### 2. Improved User Data Directory Handling
- Added UUID to make directory names more unique
- Added directory cleanup logic to ensure empty state
- Used timestamp + random number + UUID for uniqueness

### 3. Added Fallback Mechanism
- First attempt uses user data directory for isolation
- If that fails (due to conflicts), tries again without user data directory
- Provides better error handling and logging

## Result
- Chrome is now successfully detected at `/usr/bin/google-chrome`
- Application launches Chrome without user data directory conflicts
- Successfully tested with curl command showing Chrome version 139.0.7258.66

## Testing
Confirmed working by:
1. Direct Chrome detection test showing Chrome at multiple paths
2. Successful API call to `/start_scan` endpoint
3. Chrome driver initialized successfully and navigated to test page
